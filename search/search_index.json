If you want to deploy a server for your game, you can use Shardz to manage multiple instances of your game server, each running a different scene. Features Easy to use Supports multiple instances of the same server Supports multiple servers Supports multiple scenes Player authentication Main server and multiple world servers Highly modulable tools Why ? Unity is a wonderful game engine. It is easy to use and has a lot of features. However, it is not really made for server deployment. It is not really made for multiplayer games either. It is made for single player games. The most problematic feature is that Unity does not support multiple scenes. This means that you can only have one scene loaded at a time. This is a problem for multiplayer games, because you need to have multiple scenes loaded at the same time. For example, you need to have a scene for the lobby, a scene for the game, a scene for the shop, etc. You need to be able to switch between these scenes. Obviously, the player will only be able to see one scene at a time, but the server needs to be able to load and unload scenes at will. This is not possible with Unity. This is where Shardz comes in. Shardz allows you to deploy multiple instances of your game server, each running a different scene. This allows you to have multiple scenes loaded at the same time. This allows you to have a lobby, a game, a shop, etc. all running at the same time. Shardz is not created to replace Unity. It still uses Unity to run the game server. It is created to allow you to deploy multiple instances of your game server, each running a different scene. That means that you will be able to use every feature of Unity, including the Unity Editor as well as every asset you can find on the Unity Asset Store. Shardz only manage moving from one scene to another, spawning servers as needed for you.","title":"Welcome to Shardz"},{"location":"#welcome-to-shardz","text":"Shardz is a simple server manager intended for use with Unity (and possibly other game engines) to allow for easy deployment of multiple scenes servers.

Shardz is separated into multiple parts: the master server, the world servers and the game servers. Some of those (mostly the master server) is sub-divided into multiple parts. The goal of this separation is to allow for a modular design. Terminology Master server: This server is the main entry point for the player. It is tasked with authenticating the player and serving the list of available world servers. World server: This server is responsible for managing the world. It is tasked with loading and unloading scenes, spawning and despawning game servers, etc. Game server: This server is responsible for running the game.
